        <p class="p-4 m-0 pt-0">

            of the information available to us points to the same conclusion: Hawaii
            is a magical place, and this enchantment permeates each of the islands.

            strong that many people report having life-changing experiences during
            their visit. But even with so many wonderful sights to see and things to
            do, there are a few experiences that really should be at the top of your
            list. So take some notes as we share our version of the Top 10 Things to

                            The 'lolani Palace (Hawaiian: Hale Ali'i 'lolani) was the royal
                            residence of the rulers of the Kingdom of Hawaii beginning with
                            Kamehameha III under the Kamehameha Dynasty (1845) and ending with
                            Queen Lili'uokalani (1893) under the Kalākaua Dynasty, founded by
                            her brother, King David Kalākaua. It is located in the capitol
                            district of downtown Honolulu in the U.S. state of Hawai'i. It is
                            now a National Historic Landmark listed on the National Register
                            of Historic Places. After the monarchy was overthrown in 1893, the
                            building was used as the capitol building for the Provisional
                            Government, Republic, Territory, and State of Hawai'i until 1969.
                            The palace was restored and opened to the public as a museum in
                            1978. The 'lolani Palace is the only royal palace on US soil
