    <h4 class="text-info">Getting the best from interaction devices</h4>
    <p class="lead">
      Once we have chosen an interaction device for a user interface, we need
      to consider how to use it effectively. We have relatively little control
      over the appearance or use of input devices, so we concentrate on the
      design of the feedback provided by output devices. In particular, we
      concentrate on the following software components that form this
      feedback. Text. How can we ensure that the text is legible? Which font
      should we use? How long should the lines be? Colour. Which colours go
      well together? How should colour be used in order to communicate
      information more effectively? How can we ensure that the colours we use
      have the correct connotations? Images. What are the different types of
      image? How do you choose the right one? Moving images. When is it useful
      to animate images? When can video clips be used to good effect? Sound.
      When can sound be useful? What are the different categories of sound and
      when should each be used? Many of these issues are also relevant to
      input devices, such as the choice of colour for the panic button in a
      train or the font chosen for entering text into a form-fill application.
      These software components are usually relatively easy and cheap to
      change, but applying them in a consistent and thoughtful manner can make
      a big difference to the usability of the User Interface (UI). It is
      important to be clear what you are trying to achieve when you use these
      components. We are assuming that you want to communicate information and
      functionality in a simple but effective manner. This is different to a
      graphic designer, whose priority may be to create a design that is fresh
      and innovative. These differences have practical implications. For
      example,. an advertising website designed by a graphic designer may have
      shorter line lengths, and employ more colours and images than we would
      recommend.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-info">Text</h4>
    <p class="lead">
      Text is the dominant component in most education and training software,
      and on many websites. It also plays a central role in standard software
      applications such as word processors and spreadsheets. It is a flexible
      and powerful means of communication.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-info">Color</h4>
    <p class="lead">
      Screens can only display a subset of the colours visible to the human
      eye. This limits the accuracy of colour reproduction. There is also
      variation between computers, so a web page on a PC may look different
      when viewed on a Macintosh. There are similar problems with colour
      printers. These issues can cause problems for some sectors, such as the
      fashion industry. There are also differences in the way we perceive
      colour from a screen compared to the way we perceive colour from paper.
      This means that the screen versions of colours can appear rather pale
      and unreal when compared with the equivalent paper versions. It also
      increases the likelihood of flickering for colour combinations such as
      red and blue.

      Choosing colours with the right connotations culture
    </h4>
    <p class="lead">
      When you use a colour, you should think about what it is likely to mean
      to the people who look at it, as colours can have different
      connotations. Colours can even make people feel different. For example,
      pink has been shown to have a calming effect on emotionally disturbed
      people. These connotations are partly cultural, so you may find they do
      not ring true for you if you are a member of a non-western culture, such
      as Chinese or Indian. For example, in western red is often used as a
      warning colour, but in China it is a joyful colour. However,
      connotations can be learned and our society is increasingly
      international, so these differences are gradually becoming less of an
      issue. As communications improve, it is increasingly the case that the
      employees of multinational firms can have more in common with each other
      than with people living in their home towns. Even connotations widely
      accepted in western culture, such as red for danger, need to be used
      with care. For example, a car may have a red light that indicates when
      the handbrake is on. This correctly warns that you could damage the car
      if you drive off with the handbrake on. However, it also effectively
      indicates that it is safe to take your foot off the brake pedal when the
      car is on a hill. This mixed message is rather confusing, and it might
      have been better to use another colour. The situation is simpler for
      domains where established colour conventions already exist. For example,
      in British politics, red is associated with the Labour Party and blue
      with the Conservative Party. This type of colour coding can be applied
      more easily. The colour saturation can also be significant. Colours
      aimed at young people tend to be pure and bright, whereas colours
      evoking the natural world are relatively subdued, and colours aimed at
      older people are deeper. Fashion also plays an important role in the
      choice of colours, particularly for young people. For example, the
      colour of fashionable clothes changes regularly, as does the colour of
      home d√©cor. Thus you should not use bright orange if it is thought to
      look dated. As this area is so subjective, it is difficult to know how
      to apply these ideas. We are really straying into the domain of graphic
      designers. However, you still need to make decisions about the colours
      that you use, so you should do this carefully. Make sure that you apply
      the colours consistently, always taking into account the characteristics
      of the users, the tasks they are carrying out and the environment in
      which they will be using the computer system. It is good practice to
      evaluate your choices with users in order to inform your decisions.
