              The head chef, Mike Lofaro, is renowned for his modern take on
              Hawaiian seasonal cuisine. His latest culinary experiment is to
              employ the Hawaiian moon calendar system, traditionally used by
              locals to dictate their eating, farming and fishing habits.
              Lofaro will rotate his menu throughout the year based on the
              ingredients that can be harvested, fished or foraged according
              to the current lunar cycle. Guests can try Lofaro's contemporary
              interpretation of traditional fish and poi, a staple of native
              Hawaiian cuisine. Housed in a native hale thatched structure,
              the interior of the restaurant references Hawaiian culture. It
              features ohia hardwood posts and rafters, lauhala weave ceiling
              panels, and an inscribed ode to local traditions of ocean
              voyaging and wayfinding.
